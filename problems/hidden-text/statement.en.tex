\problemname[output-only]{Hidden text}
It's spring of 2020.
The active life of Yerevan has stopped.
Everyone is bored, especially Hayk and Bell, so they decided to play a game.

The game is simple: Bell thinks of a word $W$, and Hayk has to guess $W$.
To give Hayk some chance, Bell has given Hayk a \href{http://ejudge.rau.am/ejudge/hayktable.html}{big table} of letters.
As a hint, for each letter of $W$, Bell tells Hayk a location in the table where that letter appears.
The location is given as a (row, column) pair, with indexing starting from $1$.

For example, if the Bell gives Hayk the following locations:
\begin{center}
    (3, 3), (4, 4), (2, 3)
\end{center}
then Bell's hidden word is ``dur''.

After winning 2491 rounds of this game, Hayk needs your help to win the last 2492th round.
The hint from Bell for this round is
\begin{center}
    (17, 32), (23, 50), (29, 59), (35, 64), (42, 77), (48, 86), (56, 92), (62, 100).
\end{center}
