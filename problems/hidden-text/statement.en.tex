\problemname{Hidden text}
It's spring of 2020.
The active life of Yerevan is stopped and everyone is locked down in their apartments.
It's boring for everyone, and especially for Hayk and Bell. 
To have some fun they decided to play a game.

Game rules are pretty simple.
Hayk has one \href{http://ejudge.rau.am/ejudge/hayktable.html}{big table} of letters. And during each round he thinks up a word, which Bell should find out. As a hint he gives (row,column) pairs of each letter in his table to Bel.
Rows and columns are numbered from 1.

E.g. If row column numbers are

(4, 4); (4, 1); (2, 4)


Then Hayk's word is "dur".
You can see in the given html table that 4th element of 4th row is 'd', first element of 4th row is 'u' and 4th element of the second row is 'r'.

Hayk always uses the same table and at first Bel was reconstructing words quite fast.
But during 2492th round Hayk asked him to find 8 letter word, which he wasn't able to do.
And now Bel asks for your help.

Please reconstruct the hidden word that is described by the following (row, column) pairs.

(51, 70); (67, 79); (83, 88); (99, 109); (115, 140); (131, 167); (147, 213); (163, 244)
