\problemname[output-only]{Can you unzip me?}
To spend the lockdown period effectively Eduard decided to clean his computer's hard disk from unnecessary files.
He knew that there were many of them, but he never expected to find a file called ``big.txt'' of about 400 GB in size.
When Eduard tried to open the file, his text editor crashed.
He can't remember how and why this file was created.

Fortunately Eduard found another file called ``small.txt'', and he was able to open it using his text editor.
This file was full of whitespace, but contained one hidden phrase somewhere in the middle of it.
The hidden phrase was ``happy\_new\_year''.

Seeing this, Eduard remembered that ``big.txt'' has a similar format, i.e., it mostly contains a whitespace with exactly one non-whitespace phrase hidden in it.

He has asked you to find the hidden phrase in ``big.txt''.
He zipped the file, and then zipped the resulting file again (double zipping), so he can give it to you.
Thinking that it might help you, he has also double-zipped ``small.txt'' and given to you.
Help him to find the phrase in ``big.txt''.

You can download both files by the following links.
