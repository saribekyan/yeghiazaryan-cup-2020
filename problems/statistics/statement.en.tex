\problemname[stdin/stdout]{Statistics}
Eduard loves to look at statistics and during the COVID-19 pandemic he monitors its development.
It has been exactly $N$ days since the first case of the virus appeared,
and Eduard has collected the number of new cases per day in an array $D$ of length $N$.
He thinks that one of the most important metrics is the maximum number of daily new cases of the virus during last $K$ days.
Eduard asks you to write a program which will help him to create this very important metric in a new array $M$.

%For example, if $K = 3$ and the number of daily new cases in the first seven days of the pandemic is given by the array
%$D = [7, 5, 80, 40, 3, 2, 97]$,
%then Eduard will create a new array
%$M = [7, 7, 80, 80, 80, 40, 97]$ where $M[i]$ shows the highest number of new cases for the days $i, i - 1, i - 2$.\htodo{what's the example for?}

\section*{Input}
The first line of the input contains two integers
$N (1 \leq N \leq 10^5)$, the number of days from the first reported case of the virus, and $K (1 \leq K \leq N)$.
Second line contains $N$ space-separated non-negative integers, the elements of the array  $D$.
The maximum number of daily new cases is $10^9$.

\section*{Output}
The only line of the output must contain $N$ numbers -- values of array $M$.
