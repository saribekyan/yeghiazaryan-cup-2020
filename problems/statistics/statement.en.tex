\problemname{Statistics}

Eduard loves statistics and during pandemic he monitors daily new cases and other related statistics. He thinks that one of the important metrics is the maximum number of daily new cases during last $K$ days. For example if statistics of daily cases for one week is given in array $A = [7, 5, 80, 40, 3, 2, 97]$ and $K=3$ then he will create new array $B = [7, 7, 80, 80, 80, 40, 97]$ where $B[i]$ shows the highest number of cases for the days $i, i - 1, i - 2$.

Eduard asks you to write a program which will help him to create new array $B$ from the given array $A$ and number $K$.

\section*{Input}
The first line of the input contains two integer $N (1 \leq N \leq 10^5)$ number of elements in array $A$ and $K (1 \leq K \leq N)$.
Second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_i (1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9)$.

\section*{Output}
The only line of the output must contain $N$ numbers - values of array $B$.
