---------- alternative problem

All viruses are convex.
A virus is dangerous if it has an acute angle (< 90 degrees).
You have to print a 0-1 array if a virus is dangerous or no.
If the angle is 80-100 degrees, both 0 and 1 are OK, otherwise it must be precise.

\htodoi{Note, that now we do not need to write that all angles are at most 170 degrees.}
\htodoi{Does this make the solution easier?}

---------------
As an expert virologist you have developed a microscope that can take high-resolution images of viruses.
The result is an image that shows only the ``shell'' or the ``boundary'' of the virus.
It is known that the shell of every virus has a shape of a convex polygon, but
it also has some thickness.

You have collected a database of images of 3000 viruses.\htodo{link}
Since the most important feature of a virus is the number of cor


You have been studying viruses for some time and have created a
