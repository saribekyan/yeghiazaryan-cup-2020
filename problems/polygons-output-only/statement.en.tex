\problemname[output-only]{Virus shapes}
Your are an expert virologist and over the past decades have discovered many interesting facts about viruses.
Your first discovery was that all the viruses look like a convex polygons.
Later you discovered that the internal angles of all viruses (polygons) are between 10 and 170 degrees, because otherwise they cannot live.

Your new theory is that the number of corners of the virus (polygon) determines how dangerous the virus is.
To test this hypothesis, you developed a microscope that can take images of any virus.
The result is an image that shows only the ``shell'' or the ``boundary'' of the virus, which is enough to determine the number of its corners.
Additionally, your genius microscope has such a high resolution that the sides of all the viruses (polygons) has at least $120$ pixels in the image.

Your assistant has collected a database of images of $3000$ viruses.\htodo{link}
To test your theory, your first task is to find the number of corners of each of the $3000$ viruses.
Correctly determining the number of corners on $99\%$ of the viruses will be sufficient to test your theory and win a Nobel prize.\htodo{fix the percentage}

\section*{Input}
There is no input for this problem, except for the link above.
Here is an alternative link to the page.\htodo{link}

\section*{Output}
You should simply upload or paste a space-separated list containing the number of corners of each virus in the online judge, on a single line, without spaces.
For example, below is a (wrong) answer with in the correct format:
\begin{center}
    \texttt{5 3 7}
\end{center}
If your answer is correct on at least $99\%$ of the viruses, your solution will pass.

%
%All viruses are convex.
%A virus is dangerous if it has an acute angle (< 90 degrees).
%You have to print a 0-1 array if a virus is dangerous or no.
%If the angle is 80-100 degrees, both 0 and 1 are OK, otherwise it must be precise.
%
%\htodoi{Note, that now we do not need to write that all angles are at most 170 degrees.}
%\htodoi{Does this make the solution easier?}
