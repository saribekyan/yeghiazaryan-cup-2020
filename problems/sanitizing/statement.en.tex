\problemname[stdin/stdout]{Sanitizing}
\textit{
Germs are everywhere!
They can get onto hands and items we touch during daily activities and make you ill. Cleaning hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer is one of the most important steps you can take to avoid getting sick and spreading germs.
If soap and water are not available, you should use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60\% alcohol.

During COVID-19 the above statement has been the top recommendation to protect against the spread of the pandemic.
As a socially responsible person Eduard decided to follow the recommendations and buy a sanitizer.
But the nearest pharmacy did not have a sanitizer with 60\% alcohol content available, so Eduard decided to buy $X$ liters of 96\% alcohol and prepare a sanitizer with 60\% alcohol content by mixing water (0\% alcohol) with it.

He needs your help to calculate how much water to mix with $X$ liters of \textbf{96\%} alcohol to get his home-made sanitizer with \textbf{60\%} alcohol content.
