\problemname[output-only]{Formula One}
Eduard likes statistics very much.
And he also is a Formula One fan.
That why he decided to pull some statistics about \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_World_Champions}{Formula One World Championships}.
First he prepared a list of all data requests that he needs to pull and started to pull data from Wikipedia.
He did for the first 5 requests, but got tired after that, because it was taking too long.

Now Eduard asks you for the help.
You can find the list of all the requests here \href{http://ejudge.rau.am/ejudge/formula1.txt}{Formula1.txt}.

\section*{Input}
There is no input for this problem, except for the link above.
Here is an \href{http://167.71.248.201/ejudge/formla1.txt}{alternative link} to the page.

\section*{Output}
